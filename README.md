# **PolaFit - A Digital Companion for a Healthy Lifestyle**

## **Description**  
PolaFit is an app designed to address the challenges of achieving a sustainable healthy lifestyle, from challenges such as lack of advice personalized to the user, time constraints, and difficulty maintaining motivation. Many people find it difficult to balance their health goals of losing weight, keeping fit, or gaining muscle mass because the advice provided is often too general, progress tracking is unclear, and programs are too rigid to meet their specific needs. PolaFit solves this problem by providing nutrition and exercise recommendations tailored to the user's health profile, preferences, and goals. It uses data-driven algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach to analyze food images that support a variety of visual analysis-based features such as auto-detection, accurate nutrition tracking, and real-time exercise feedback that enhance user experience through accuracy and personalization of services.
